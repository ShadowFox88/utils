# Utils
This is simply a repository that I use to dump all useful utility/any useful functionality I think would be useful to use across multiple projects, all within the comfort of a single, concentrated location.

## Navigation
Everything here is organised by branches and named by language, expect utilities for a set language (i.e., JavaScript) to be in a branch dedicated named and dedicated to that language (`javascript`),

## Supported Languages
- [JavaScript](https://github.com/cyrus01337/utils/tree/javascript)
- [Luau](https://github.com/cyrus01337/utils/tree/luau)
- [Python](https://github.com/cyrus01337/utils/tree/python)

## Licensing
You are free to do as you wish with what is provided here. I do not deem myself to be the greatest programmer nor will I assume that anything provided here to be helpful to anyone but myself, so feel free to use/modify/claim these as you wish.
